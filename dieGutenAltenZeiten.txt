drunk kids on the beach, between the night-warm sand
and the cold waves
and then with youthful optimism our names on the bustop wall
but the rain is already blurring our tracks

look at the ticking clocks, time is a son of a bitch
laying our air castles in ruins
it was never forever
everything passes, everything passes
tell me what's left
everything passes, everything passes
tell me what's left
the stories we write today
will be tomorrow's good old days
and that's what will remain
of the good old days

with the guys in berlin on the tiniest stages
of this big city
squeezed into the back seat with guitars and amps
out in every dump
we've been on tour for ten years now

look at the ticking clocks, time is a son of a bitch
laying our air castles in ruins
it was never forever
everything passes, everything passes
tell me what's left
everything passes, everything passes
tell me what's left
the stories we write today
will be our tomorrow's good old days
and that's what remains
of the good old days
everything passes, everything passes
tell me what's left
everything passes, everything passes
tell me what's left
the stories we write today
these will be our good old days tomorrow
and that's what remains
of the good old days
of the good old days
of the good old days
